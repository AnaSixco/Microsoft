//Begin solving the challenge with the following two lines of code.

string projectName = "ACME";
string russianMessage = "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434";

//Instructions: 

//The projectName variable will be used twice in the desired output.

//The russianMessage variable contains the message "View Russian output" in Russian. You must use this variable in your code that prints the message.

//You may not change these two lines of code, but you can add code above and below each line. You must use these two lines of code to form the desired output.

//You may only use either the Console.WriteLine() or the Console.Write() method twice.
///In other words, to complete this challenge, you can only create two instructions that actually print output to the console. If you need to print additional new lines or add any formatting, you must use what you've learned in this module to accomplish it.

//Use character escape sequences, verbatim strings, unicode, and string interpolation to generate the output.

//Result:

Console.WriteLine("View English Output:" + "\n" + $@"c:\Exercise\{projectName}\data.txt");
Console.WriteLine( "\n" + $"{russianMessage}" + "\n" + $@"c:\Exercise\{projectName}\data.txt");

//Perform addition with implicit data conversion

int firstNumber = 12;
int secondNumber = 7;
Console.WriteLine(firstNumber + secondNumber); //Output: 19//

//Mix data types int firstNumber = 12;

string firstName = "Bob";
int widgetsSold = 7;
Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + widgetsSold + " widgets."); // Output: Bob sold 7 widgets. //

string firstName = "Bob";
int widgetsSold = 7;
Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + widgetsSold + 7 + " widgets."); // Output: Bob sold 77 widgets. // 

string firstName = "Bob";
int widgetsSold = 7;
Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + (widgetsSold + 7) + " widgets."); // Output: Bob sold 14 widgets. //

//Math Operations//
